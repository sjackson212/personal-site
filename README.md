# My personal site
This is the source code for my [personal site](https://sjackson212.github.io/personal-site). I wrote it in Reactjs in the ES6 standard, using CSS and [Facebook's spiffy React starter kit](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (which you should really try out if you're looking to get into React).

### Credits
